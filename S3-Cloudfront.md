# A practical guide to hosting a static website using AWS S3 Bucket and Cloudfront


## REQUIREMENTS
1. AWS account 
2. AWS account which isn't the root user


 ***NOTE**: I have created an AWS account called "Admin" with policy granted to have full access to all services* 


### STEP 1
On the AWS home page, search for “S3” and click on the first result that comes up

### STEP 5 
Create a Cloudfront distrubution which is one of the simple AWS services that is content delivery network for distrubuting website files to different locations around the globe which reducing latency during GET request![Create_distribution](./Screenshot%202024-05-10%20185128.png)

### STEP 6 
Here, we need to configure the new distribution being created.
1. *Origin domain* - This is the domain name given by the newly created S3 bucket

1. *Origin access* - Create a new 'Origin Access Control' which generates a policy that allows us to access S3 bucket publicly

1. *Default root object* - This is the website default page file 'index.html'

*NOTE THAT I DIDN'T ENABLE WAF in this case(Web Application Firewall)*

### STEP 7
Add policy generated by the creation of distribution to S3 Permissions
